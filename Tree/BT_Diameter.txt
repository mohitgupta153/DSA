The diameter of a tree T is the largest of the following quantities:

* the diameter of T’s left subtree
* the diameter of T’s right subtree
* the longest path between leaves that goes through the root of T (this can be computed from the heights of the subtrees of T)

Max value of Height(leftSubtree)+Height(rightSubtree) (at any node ) is the diameter. Keep track of maxium diameter duing traversal and find the height of the tree.

 int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int d = 0;
        height(root, d);
        return d;
    }
    
    int height(TreeNode* root, int& d) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return 0;
        int ld = height(root->left, d);
        int rd = height(root->right, d);
        d = max(d,ld+rd);  //  This line maintains the max diameter.
        return 1+max(ld,rd);
    }
