Memory get's divided into two distinct areas:

The user space, which is a set of locations where normal user processes run (i.e everything other than the kernel).
User space is basically a form of sand-boxing, it restricts user programs so they can't mess with memory (and other resources) owned by other programs or by the OS kernel.

The kernel is the core of the operating system. It normally has full access to all memory and machine hardware (and everything else on the machine).
The role of the kernel is to manage applications running in this space from messing with each other, and the machine.
The kernel space, which is the location where the code of the kernel is stored, and executes under.

Processes running under the user space have access only to a limited part of memory, whereas the kernel has access to all of the memory. 
Processes running in user space also don't have access to the kernel space. User space processes can only access a small part of the kernel 
via an interface exposed by the kernel - the system calls. If a process performs a system call, a software interrupt is sent to the kernel, 
which then dispatches the appropriate interrupt handler and continues its work after the handler has finished.

The High Memory is the segment of memory that user-space programs can address. It cannot touch Low Memory.

Low Memory is the segment of memory that the Linux kernel can address directly. If the kernel must access High Memory, it has to map it into its own address space first.

A typical 32bit Linux virtual memory map is like:

0x00000000-0xbfffffff: user process (3GB)

0xc0000000-0xffffffff: kernel space (1GB)
